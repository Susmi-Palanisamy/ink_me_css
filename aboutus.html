<h3>Before we formed MuffinGroup, our “gang of four” worked for an interactive agency, which is where we first met.we took stock of ourselves, and decided to strike out on our own, as a design and development team.

  We started by creating a WordPress theme called Doover. It was rejected, but we stuck with it, and it was eventually approved. With that successful venture under our belts, we took the next step; we quit our full-time jobs and started our own company.
  
  Doover is still up and running. We’ve sold more than 2,000 copies, and it is one of over a dozen WordPress themes making up our product line. In fact, Doover has outsold most of our other WordPress themes, but there is one very big exception.
  
  In terms of staffing, we are a very small company. In terms of sales, we are huge; at least in terms of WordPress theme sales.</h3>

<div class="div2"><h1>WE HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF ART</h1>
  <h3>Tattoo artists must have a clear and deep understanding not to mention an appreciation of art. That is the reason they are called artists. However, as much as you have the skill to be on the pedestal of success, learning about art takes time, patience and practice. </h3>
<h3>You especially need to have a sound and creative mind and couple this with putting down your sketches on paper trying to make it as unique and appealing as possible.If you take up the challenge of learning about art, you can do frequent research from different books or take art classes to start you off.</h3></div>   </center>

In terms of sales, we are huge; at least in terms of WordPress theme sales. That is largely because of a product of ours that recently exceeded 25,000 in sales – Be Theme.</h3>
